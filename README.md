# Forest-flame-simulation

## Project Description​

This project is a simulation of fire spreading across a terrain map, implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Users can initiate fires, control atmospheric conditions such as wind direction and speed, and humidity, and take actions to halt the spread of the fire, such as deploying water or clearing forested areas.

## Technologies Used​

Python,Pygame,NumPy

## Features​

Fire Spread Simulation: 

Models the spread of fire across a terrain map based on environmental conditions.​

Wind and Humidity Controls: Adjust wind direction, wind speed, and humidity to observe their effects on fire behavior.​

## User Interactions:​

Initiate fires by clicking on the map.​

Deploy water to extinguish fires and create barriers.​

Clear forested areas to prevent fire spread.​

Pause and Reset Simulation: Pause the simulation to analyze the current state or reset to the initial conditions.
